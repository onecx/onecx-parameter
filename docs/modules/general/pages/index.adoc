== What is Parameter Management?
Parameter Management (Parameter Management) refers to storing and retrieving Parameter items usable in context of OneCX applications.

== Key Features
* Parameter item Storage and Retrieval: Store and retrieve Parameter items usable in context of OneCX applications.

== How to use with Quarkus
We provide a Quarkus extension that enables applications to seamlessly utilize parameters. For detailed instructions on how to use it, please refer to the following documentation:

== Overview
OneCX Parameter Management Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Parameter items in a user-friendly and efficient manner.
It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer.

The three components of the OneCX Parameter Management Software are as follows:

. Parameter Management User Interface (UI)
  The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
  It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Parameter Management system.
  Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Parameter items.

. Parameter Management Backend for Frontend (BFF)
  The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service.
  It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI.
  The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service.

. Parameter Management Backend Service (SVC)
  This component provides the core functionality.
  It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Parameter items.
  The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus.

Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard link:https://github.com/tmforum-apis/TMF667_Document[TMF 667].
